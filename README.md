Spotify Dataset 2023

This project is designed to explore the Spotify Dataset 2023 to uncover insights into music trends, artist popularity, and track characteristics. This dataset offers a comprehensive collection of music data, including features such as track popularity, artist information, and audio attributes.  

Here is a short description of the main features of Spotify Dataset 2023:  
- "album_popularity" : "The popularity of the album. The value will be between 0 and 100, with 100 being the most popular."  
- "artist_0" : "Main Artist"  
- "artist_popularity" : "The popularity of the artist. The value will be between 0 and 100, with 100 being the most popular.  
- "followers" : "The total number of followers."  
- "genre_0" : "Main Genre"  
- "acousticness" : "A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic.  
- "danceability" : "Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements."

The project is divided into three key parts:  
- **Data Exploration:** Provides an overview of the dataset and includes handling null values.
- **Data Analysis:** Involves data visualization techniques to uncover patterns and insights within the dataset.
- **Machine Learning:** Utilizes Linear Regression and Random Forest models to predict track popularity based on selected features.
